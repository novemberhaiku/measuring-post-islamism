<p>Post-Islamism is a key concept in the study of Islamism and the politics of the Islamic world. It was introduced in the mid-1990s by the scholar Asef Bayat, but was more clearly fleshed out by Olivier Roy. These two scholars are still those that most people interested in post-Islamism turn to in order to understand the concept. However, the concept continues to be muddy. It is used as a descriptive term, an analytical one, and a normative one. It may be a condition or a project (Bayat 2005, 5). It is used in qualitative study to understand Muslim-majority societies and how they are moving politically. Comparison of the ideas of Islamism and post-Islamism shows changes in how Muslims speak about politics, though both exist together (Bayat 2005, 5). This paper seeks to look at the phenomenon quantitatively by creating an index based on the World Values Survey (WVS). This will allow for different kinds of studies of Muslim-majority societies to be done. Additionally, it may open new avenues for studies of how other majority religions relate to politics.
